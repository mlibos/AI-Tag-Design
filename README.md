# AI-Tag-Design
AI Design Project @IPI for generating new epitope tags and nanobodies that bind to them. 

Current Pipeline:
* Redesign of epitope tags using original Alfa Tag as a template for design.
* Use ProteinMPNN as the redesign framework for generating Alfa Tags
* Initial input methods consisted of: only using the alfa tag, using the alfa tag and nbAlfa while fixing nbAlfa, and using the alfa tag and nbAlfa while allowing for redesign of binding residues on nbAlfa.
* Tags generated by the alfa tag and redesigned nbAlfa were the most promising. 10,000 candidate tags were generated by ProteinMPNN
* Filtering of candidate tags was conducted. Candidates were filtered by biophysical properties (net charge at physiological pH, GRAVY score for hydrophobicity, and presence of unwanted residues), filtered by similarity to one another and the original tag, and by BLASTp results against the refseq database.
* From the list of filtered candidates we selected the top five tags by overall diversity as the epitope tags that we will design nanobody binders for.
* Two methods are being considered for nanobody design: Using the original nbAlfa as a template and redesigning the binder residues using LigandMPNN and de novo binder design using BoltzDesign1.
* Currently Here!
